// This item provides the novel "Dual Kawase" effect [1], which offers a very ideal
// balance of quality and performance. It has been used by many applications since
// its introduction in 2015, including the KWin compositor. Qt 5's `FastBlur` from
// 2011, and its Qt 6 port `MultiEffect` already offers a performant blur effect,
// utilizing a similar down/up sampling trick, but it does not use the half-pixel
// trick, and does not work for textures in the atlas, or sub-textures (detaching
// or additional layer incurs an additional buffer).
